# ForestRunGame
A Unity video game I did with some classmates. Here is my contribution:

Moulaye Zein Haidara:
Zein took charge of importing the necessary assets for the cat and Pier's houses, ensuring seamless integration into the game environment. Initially, he attempted to create an AI script for the cat - AIpatrol.cs. When faced with implementation challenges, he collaborated effectively with Kevin to adapt his EnemyChasing script, tailoring it to suit the cat's behavior. Sami further enhanced the cat's appearance by fine-tuning its animation and size, ensuring it harmoniously blended with the scene. Zein also integrated teleportation and scoring systems for the houses, relying on NextLevel.cs for teleportation and EndGame.cs for managing game conclusions. Note that the triggers only work if a GameObject has the script InHouseTrigger.cs.
Also helped on refining HUD and menu's canvas.

Scripts:

EnemyControlScript
